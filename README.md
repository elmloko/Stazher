# Attendance Control System and Payroll System for interns of the Bolivian Postal Agency "STAZHER"

The main objective of the project was to implement an Attendance Control System and a Payroll System specifically designed for the intern staff of the Bolivian Post Office. These systems sought to improve efficiency and accuracy in recording attendance, as well as speed up and automate the payroll process for this group of employees.

The Attendance Control System was developed as a web application accessible from any device with an Internet connection. It allowed interns to sign in and out electronically, eliminating the need for manual sign-ins and physical time sheets. Attendance data is securely stored in a centralized database, making it easy for supervisors and administrators to access and analyze.

During the development process, extensive tests were carried out to verify the functionality and usability of the systems. In addition, training sessions were conducted for the agency's intern staff and administrative team, ensuring a successful adoption and smooth transition to the new systems.

The result of the project was a resounding success, as the Attendance Control and Payroll systems for interns significantly improved the accuracy, efficiency and transparency in personnel management. Interns and the administrative team experienced a reduction in administrative workload and greater confidence in the accuracy of payments and attendance records.
